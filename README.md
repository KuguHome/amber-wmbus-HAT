# Wireless M-Bus Raspberry Pi 3+ hat
This repository holds the schematics and PCB design for a hat
which provides wireless M-Bus connectivity through the on-board
UART on the Raspberry Pi.

The schematics and PCB were designed on KiCAD[1], a free and
open source CAD for electronics.

The board consists on a AMB8426-M plus some components to
adapt an external antenna and a power input which will
power the Raspberry through an external power source.
